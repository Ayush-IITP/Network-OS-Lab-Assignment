A folder named â€‹OS contains four non-empty and one empty text files. Each of the
non-empty files contains different number of sentences. Write a program in shell script to
copy the first sentence from each non-empty file to the empty file. The sentences should
be placed based on the ascending order of the size of the non-empty files.
