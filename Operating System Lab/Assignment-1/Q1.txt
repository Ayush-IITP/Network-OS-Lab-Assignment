   difference :
     available memory = free memory + cached memory
     free memory = free memory

  free memory = This is memory that is currently unused by the system and contains no useful data at all. 
                It is free to be used by the system at any time.
  available memory = While this sounds extremely similar to free memory, 
                     it is actually a broader category that includes both free memory and cached memory.
