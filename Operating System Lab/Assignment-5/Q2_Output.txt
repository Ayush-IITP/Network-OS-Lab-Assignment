pthread1 is accessing function f()
Lock acquired by pthread1
pthread2 cannot access function f() lock acquired by pthread1
Lock released by pthread1
pthread2 is accessing function f()
Lock acquired by pthread2
Lock released by pthread2


//Explanation :
Initially pthread1 start accessing myFunc then a lock is initialized,after which when pthread2 try to access lead to error pthread1 is accessing it.When pthread1 releases lock pthread2 access it normally.
