//Explanation :
In this we have first tried to pick the left fork then right fork and then printed the desired matrix an finally drop the left and then right one.A case of deadlock may arise when all philosopher has picked up the left one,in this case we randomly choose a person and force him to drop his left fork.To achieve correctness in result we have used semaphores and mutex lock.
